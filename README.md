# Ants-Algorithm
NOTE: In its current state the program does not run as it is still being worked on. This readme is just to understand how the algorithm could work and the theory behind it.
## Description
An algorithm inspired by the way ants use pheromones that can find near optimal solutions to travelling salesman problems.

This project was inspired by a Sebastian Lague video where he vaguely descibes an algorithm based on how ants find food. The algorithm is my technical interpretation of what he described.
